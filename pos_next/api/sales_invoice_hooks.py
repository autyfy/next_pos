	Validate hook for Sales Invoice.
	1. Always correct place_of_supply from billing_address_gstin (for ALL invoices).
	   IC's validate_transaction only validates an existing POS but never recalculates it,
	   so a stale client-sent value (e.g. company state instead of customer state) is
	   saved as-is.  We fix this by recomputing before IC's validation runs.
	2. Apply tax-inclusive settings (POS invoices only).
	3. Adjust paid_amount for finance-lender payments (POS invoices only).
